### Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is a way of thinking which enhances your capacity to learn, by taking challenges and obstacles in your stride rather than giving up or getting frustrated.

#### How to keep a Growth Mindset

> If you find yourself to be frustrated, remind yourself that every challenge is an opportunity to learn.

> Set a routine for yourself and try your best to stick to in, routine can help relax your mind.

> Remember that you aren't expected to know everything right away, questions and Google are your friend.
